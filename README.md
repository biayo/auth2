# auth2
My JWT Authentication (and Authorization) exercise using node.js

This project is ~~shamelessly copied~~ based on two videos from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified)

* [User Authentication - Password Login](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud5xKCYQTjM)
* [JWT Authentication Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbsmsi7l3r4)

## desired architecture

Besides Node.Js and the packages used in the videos, would like to connect/use mongoDB to persist the data generated, but using docker to avoid installing mongoDB locally.
